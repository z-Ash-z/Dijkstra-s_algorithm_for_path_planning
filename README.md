# Dijkstra-s_algorithm_for_path_planning

1. Dijkstra-pathplanning-Aneesh-Chodisetty.py - The main file that contains the Dijkstra algorithm for path planning
	- To run the file type 'python Dijkstra-pathplanning-Aneesh-Chodisetty.py' or 'python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-Aneesh-Chodisetty.py' in the terminal
	- First the created maze will be displayed in the 'Maze Explorer' window, press any key to continue
	- Follow the prompt in the terminal:
		- Type Y/Yes (case insensitive) to provide customized user input for initial and goal node (format for node: x y or x, y)
	- Based on the initial and goal node the code will run the Dijkstra algorithm to find the optimal path
	- The explored nodes and optimal path are visualized in the 'Maze Explorer' window
	- 'generated_path.avi' file is generated which has the recording of the generated path

2. maze_explorer_libraries.py - Contains the libraries needed for the Dijkstra-pathplanning-Aneesh-Chodisetty.py

3. Libraries used - cv2, numpy and copy
